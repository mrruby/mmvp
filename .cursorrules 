We use bun instead of npm in this project.

export let -> $props
In Svelte 4, properties of a component were declared using export let. Each property was one declaration. In Svelte 5, all properties are declared through the $props rune, through destructuring:


<script>
	old export let optional = 'unset';
	old export let required;
	new let { optional = 'unset', required } = $props();
</script>
